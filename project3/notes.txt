1. Enter the number of hours it took you to complete the project between
   the <<< and >>> signs below (eg, <<<10>>>).

    In this project I had to implement parsing support for various terminals and
    keywords, as well as adding more support for two more basic types. I did this
    by following the Java Lexical grammar and the Abstract Syntax Tree. In
    Parser.java I had to add additional functionality to exsisting classes
    and I had to create new classes. I had to follow the syntax of the Java
    Grammar precisely otherwise so that the complier could accurately
    parse the program. If I did not follow the AST precisely then bugs would occur.
    I was able to do a few of the problems completely, and I was able to get most
    of them started.

2. Enter the difficulty level (1: very easy; 5: very difficult) of the project
   between the <<< and >>> signs below (eg, <<<3>>>).
